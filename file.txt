Q1. How would you move your local repo to a remote GitHub repo?
Describe the step you would take to add the remote GitHub repo,Push your local changes and verify that the files were successfully transferred.
Initialize Local Git Repository (if not already initialized):

bash
Copy code
git init
Add Files to the Local Repository: Use git add to stage files.

bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit the Changes Locally:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Create a Remote Repository on GitHub:

Go to GitHub, click on "New repository", and create a new repository.
Donâ€™t initialize it with a README.md file.
Add the Remote GitHub Repository URL: Copy the URL of your GitHub repository and add it as a remote to your local repository.

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Push Local Repository to Remote GitHub Repository:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
Verify that Files Were Successfully Transferred:

Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser and check the files.
Alternatively, run git status locally to confirm that there are no unpushed changes.
